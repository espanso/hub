## Espanso package commands to make life easier

This package has commands you can use to generate [espanso](https://espanso.org/) functions.
Instead of writing out the functions yourself, this will do it for you.

### Usage

The following commands currently exist in this package:

- `:trig` - creates a simple :trigger ←→ :replace relationship function
- `:output` - Creates a function that contains variable logic (e.g. allows you to change output based on input)
- `:inputfunc` - creates a simple regex function, e.g. if input is “:hi Name ”, the output will be “Hey, Name!”

### Examples

- See source code for output examples; it is exhaustively commented


### Future Improvements

- add forms
- add variable functions that combine input variables with variables like :output
