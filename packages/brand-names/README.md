# Espanso Accented Words

Simple package to extend [Espanso](https://espanso.org) with some brand and product names correctly capitalized.

## Installation

```
espanso install brand-names
```

## Usage

Type the brand name, and it'll appropriately capitalize. This leverages the `propagate_case` to carry through ALL CAPS if needed.

Here are a few examples...

* wikipedia > Wikipedia
* wordpress > WordPress
* greenfax > GreenFax
* fastspring > FastSpring
* evernote > Evernote
* bitcan > BitCan
