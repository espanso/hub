# Relative Date

This package solves the problem to enter absolute dates in the future,
when you only know this is n days / weeks / months / years away. 

## Prerequisites

Besides espanso you will need to have python installed. I have tested
this both on linux and on windows.

## Usage

+2w expand to the date two weeks in the future. +/- is supported

```
d = days
w = weeks
m = months
y = years
```
