# ‚öîÔ∏è CNSNNT Highlander Edition: *There Can Be Only One* ‚öîÔ∏è

>"Why waste time type lot letter when **few letter do trick**."

This package is a set of **zero-collision** shorthand triggers, allowing you to instantly expand common English words by typing (mostly) only their consonants. This "Highlander" edition ensures that every trigger maps to a single, most-common word, guaranteeing maximum accuracy.

>"**60% of the time, it works every time.**"

<small>**Looking for more flexibility?** For a package where you can choose between multiple possible words for a single trigger, see [CNSNNT Standard Edition](https://hub.espanso.org/cnsnnt).</small>


## üéØ Core Philosophy: Maximum Efficiency

The system is engineered for speed by employing a few simple substitution rules:

* **Vowel Skipping:** Most vowels are omitted (`btwn` $\rightarrow$ `between`).
* **Repeated Letter Compression:** Skip redundant letters (`acs` $\rightarrow$ `access`).
* **Silent Letter Removal:** Letters that don't affect pronunciation are dropped (`bkbn` $\rightarrow$ `backbone`).
* **Phonetic Substitution:** Type it how it sounds like (`tlfn` $\rightarrow$ `telephone`, `bjt` $\rightarrow$ `budget`).


## üí° Usage

While typing, simply input the consonant-based trigger. **Espanso** will instantly expand it into the full word.

* To **undo** an expansion, just press **backspace** immediately after it appears.

### Disambiguation

The first letter can be inputted to distinguish between words with similar consonant structures:

| Trigger | Expansion |
| :--- | :--- |
| **a**dtcn | **a**ddiction |
| **e**dtcn | **e**ducation |
