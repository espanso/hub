       Given your previous history of low iron, your current fatigue is also
       likely due to low iron.  However we should complete testing to be sure
       and also confirm there are not other causes contributing.

       Also, note that factors contributing to fatigue may include psychological stress,
       anxiety, low mood, inadequate time for relaxation, poor diet, or too much alcohol.
       A healthy lifestyle is important, including stress reduction, and setting aside
       time for adequate relaxation and sleep. As well, even though you are already tired,
       gradually increasing physical exercise often helps.
