         To reduce heartburn, you are advised to avoid, or at least reduce, things that
         trigger your symptoms.  Commonly these include smoking, alcohol, coffee,
         chocolate, foods that are acidic, fatty or spicey, and non-steroidal
         anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.
         Eating smaller meals and eating at least 3 hours before bed,
         as well as weight loss and looser clothing are also helpful.
         Elevating the head of bed slightly is another useful strategy.

         Some individuals can reduce or even stop using their proton pump inhibitor
         (PPI) medication (in your case XXXXXX) for acid reflux (heartburn).
         The following document outlines strategies for stopping if you would be
         interested in reducing your medication:
         https://www.rxfiles.ca/rxfiles/uploads/documents/Deprescribing-PPI-Patient-Tool.pdf
         As noted, there may be certain benefits in stopping these medications.
         However, if they are the only treatment that controls your symptoms,
         then you should continue.

            Your symptoms are consistent with dyspepsia (upset stomach) and
            may be due to underlying excess acid production or low level stomach
            inflammation (gastritis).
            Other, less likely possibilities include liver inflammation,
            early gallbladder disease or peptic ulcer disease.

            You are advised to complete blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound to check for
            possible internal organ disease including liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.
            You are advised to start the prescribed medication Pantoprazole 40mg
            once daily 30 minutes before your morning meal.
