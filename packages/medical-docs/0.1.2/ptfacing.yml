      Once your tests are completed and results are available,
      you will hear from us.
      For some tests, this will be within 2-3 DAYS of completing the tests,
      but for other tests it will be longer.  Some blood tests take up to
      7 WORKING DAYS and MRIs can take up to 10 WORKING DAYS.

      You will be contacted regardless of whether or not the results
      require follow up. Please wait to be contacted about the results
      before booking a follow up appointment.

      If you have not received notification of your results from us
      WITHIN 5 DAYS of completing your tests, please contact us:
        Email: {{myemail}}
        Phone: {{myphone}}

      If there is a significant change in your symptoms, or decline
      in your health while waiting for the results, please do not wait
      for the results before being reassessed. Please seek out medical care
      as soon as possible if there is a significant worsening of your condition.

       Unfortunately we were not able to complete today's consult
       because I was unable to contact you.
       I attempted to contact you for video conference through the app
       and waited over 60 seconds twice.
       I then attempted to contact you by cell phone but
       you did not answer.
       I then once again attempted to contact you for video conference
       through the app and waited over 60 seconds.

       If you have not already addressed your concern in another way,
       please rebook your appointment.
