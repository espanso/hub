      Medications can sometimes be helpful for anxiety and depression.
      To be effective, they must be taken once daily, every day.
      They usually take several weeks to start having a significant effect.
      They are usually continued for at least 9 to 12 months.
      Some more common side effects include nausea, headache, sleep disturbance,
      sexual dysfunction, sweating and dry mouth.
      When first starting, they may cause a temporary increase in anxiety,
      and rarely an increase in suicidal thinking.
      If suicidal thoughts are increasing, it is important to seek help immediately.
