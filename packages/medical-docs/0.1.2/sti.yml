       Based on your symptoms, you are very likely having the rash in response to
       initial infection with a herpes simplex virus. Unfortunately, although the
       rash will heal, this virus generally never completely clears from the body
       and will very likely cause repeated outbreaks of a blistering rash.
       However, the first episode is the worst, and medications can also help
       reduce the severity and duration of future outbreaks.

       There is no blood test available to test for an active
       herpes simplex infection (HSV).  To obtain a definite diagnosis
       you would need to visit a clinic in person and have a swab of the rash.

       To reduce the duration of the current outbreak, you are advised to use the '
       prescribed medication valacyclovir (Valtrex) 2 capsules (1g) twice daily
       for 10 days. If the rash is not completely healed, please extend the
       treatment for another 10 days.

       Note that if you have recurrence of this rash, you should take the same
       medication valacyclovir (Valtrex) 1 capsule (500mg) twice daily for 3 days
       starting when you first notice a tingle or blister forming.

       To reduce discomfort, you are advised to use the prescribed topical
       lidocaine 2% gel applied up to four times daily.

       You are advised to complete a full STI (sexually transmitted infection)
       screening test including tests for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, HIV,
       Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.
       You will be contacted to arrange testing.

       Note that there can be a brief window after exposure to an STI where
       you test negative although you actually have the disease.
       If a partner has a confirmed STI but you initially test negative it
       is advised to retest 12 weeks after your last contact to confirm.

       Generally it is recommended to have STI screening at least every year,
       but if you have more than one partner or may be at higher risk, you should
       be tested at least every 6 months, and also after you have a new partner.
