      {{sp}} overall been feeling  worse  unchanged  better

      If not worse, breathing assessment questionnaire was completed:
        How is your breathing?
        Is it worse today than yesterday?
        What does your breathing prevent you from doing?

      Overall worse or breathing questions positive, so red flags were checked:

      {{sp}} no red flags, but since symptoms are worsening, now considered High Risk
      Overall not worse and breathing questions negative, so will continue to monitor
      High Risk      - every 24h for total of 14 days
      Average Risk   - every 48h for total of  7 days
      Lower Risk     - consider self monitoring, using self-monitoring checklist

      Must isolate for a minimum of 10 days from symptom onset
      or when symptoms are gone, whichever is longer.
