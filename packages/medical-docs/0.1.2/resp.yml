         Asthma is a disease that causes inflammation in the airways, narrowing the space
         available for air to flow.
         Ventolin is a bronchodilator, which helps to relax the muscles and open the airwarys temporarily
         but does not address the underlying inflammation.
         You should benefit from the addition of regular daily medications such as inhaled corticosteroids
         to help suppress the underlying inflammation, and montelukast (Singulair) which is particularly
         helpful for allergy induced asthma.
         Combination puffers such as Symbicort have both a corticosteroid to help with the inflammation and
         a bronchodilator to open th airways that is both rapid onset (close to ventolin)
         and longer acting (compared to ventolin), so can be used effectively as a rescue inhaler as well.

         A prescription has been provided to extend your use of:
         Ventolin HFA 100mcg 1-2 puffs every 4 hours as needed

         In addition, prescriptions for the following medications have been provided to try to better
         control your asthma symptoms:
         Symbicort 200 1 puff twice daily, and as needed up to a total of 8 puffs daily
         Montelukast (Singulair) 10mg once daily

         You may not need to take these medications the entire year, but regular daily consistent use during
         the allergy season should help to control your symptoms.

         You are recommended to follow-up with your regular family physician within 30 days to review how
         well these new medications are working and whether you wish to continue them or any dose adjustment
         is necessary.
