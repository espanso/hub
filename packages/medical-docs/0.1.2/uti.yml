       Based on your symptoms it is very likely you have a urinary tract infection and
       treatment can be started now.
       However, it would also be useful to submit a sample of urine for culture to confirm the infection
       and help guide treatment if the initial treatment is not working.
       On discussion, you have responded well to previous treatments for urinary tract infection and
       do not want to pursue this additional testing at this time.

       You are recommended to submit a sample of urine for culture to confirm the diagnosis and
       guide treatment in case symptoms do not improve.  You will be contacted to arrange this testing.

       {{pp}} start the prescribed antibiotic: Macrobid (nitrofurantoin) 100mg twice daily for 7 days
       {{pp}} increase fluids and consider cranberry pills as these can help clear the infection faster.

       {{finish}}

       {{pp}} monitor for symptoms of kidney infection (pyelonephritis) including fever, nausea, and back pain
       and seek reassessment urgently if these symptoms develop.
