      Eczema Care Instructions:
      1. Bathing
        a. Not about frequency but duration. Must be between 5-15 minutes.
        b. Warm – lukewarm/moderate warm
        c. Do not wipe dry – Pat dry only. Leave some moisture on skin

      2. Do not use soap – use hypoallergenic baby wash once a week only (e.g. Cetaphil, Cerave, Avene, Aveeno)

      3. If needs medicated cream (Steroid (Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, Mometasone etc.) or Tacrolimus base Cream(Protopic/Elidel) ) – apply as first layer.
        a. Steroid must be used consecutively daily, then stop when controlled
           (do not use intermittently).
        b. Maximum daily use is 2 weeks
        c. After 2 weeks use of steroids must have 1-2 weeks of break
           then can resume using this again.
        d. Tacrolimus based meds can be used indefinitely until complete control.
        e. Minimize direct sun exposure when on medicated creams.

      4. Apply moisturizing creams (Cerave Cream, Vaseline Creamy, Avene Cream) – avoid lotions (has alcohol usually which dries the skin more)

      5. Add extra layer of Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline). Must be used at flare up and may be used in maintenance phase well.

      6. Maintenance – once Eczema is controlled NEVER STOP using moisturizer (e.g. Cerave) that works best for you.

      7. RELAPSE IS VERY HIGH IF YOU STOP MAINTENANCE!

       Your main concern today is possible toe nail fungus.
       Your LEFT RIGHT toenail has been discolored and thicker for the past XX
       You have no other nail involvement or previous nail fungus infections.
       You have no pain or itch or bleeding.
       You have had no previous trauma to the nails involved.

       You have tried some over the counter treatments with limited improvement.
       You have not had any previous prescription treatments.

       You have previous bloodwork showing normal liver enzyme levels.

       {{noother}}

       Your nail appears thickened with a yellowish discoloration.

       Given your history and nail appearance it is very likely there is a nail
       fungus present.

       Nail fungus can be uncomfortable and certainly affects appearance
       but if left untreated we do not expect it to lead to any serious
       health issue.
       Some patients may decide not to treat, given their other priorities.
       Treatment of nail fungus can be topical or oral.
       For infections involving only a few nails and less than half of each nail
       a topical treatment can be effective but must be continued until the nail
       grows out fully.  For toenails this is generally about 48 weeks.
       Oral treatment is considered the most effective treatment, especially if
       there are many nails involved or over half of the nail area is involved.
       Oral treatment is also shorter: 6 weeks for fingernails
       and 12 weeks for toenails
       Oral treatment is also generally lower cost than topical treatment.
       The potential drawback of oral treatment is that it does expose
       your entire body to a medication that may rarely cause side effects.
       In particular, there is some concern of potential effects on the liver
       so may not be recommended in individuals with prior liver disease.

       In your case, you have no previous medical issues and no excessive
       alcohol intake, so we believe you are at low risk for these side effects.

       After discussing the above, your preference is for oral treatment.
       After discussing the above, your preference is for topical treatment.

       To confirm the diagnosis, you are recommended to submit nail clipping for
       fungal culture.  You will be contacted to arrange this test.
       Preliminary results are usually available with 3 days, but final results
       for this test take up to 6 weeks.

       You are advised to complete a baseline check of your liver enzymes
       (ALT and AST).  You will be contacted to arrange this blood work.

       You are advised to take the prescribed medication,
       Terbinafine (Lamisil) 250mg once daily for 12 weeks as prescribed.
       Efinaconazole (Jublia) applied once daily for 48 weeks as prescribed.

       If you feel unwell and feel you may be having side-effects of the
       medication, stop the medication immediately and seek reassessment
       by a physician.
       In particular you should monitor for persistent nausea, anorexia
       (low appetite), fatigue, vomiting, right upper abdominal pain,
       jaundice (yellowish tinge to whites of eyes or skin), dark urine,
       or pale stools.

       They have not been bleeding.

       You do not have a habit of biting your lip and cannot remember biting your lip.
       You do not have braces, mouthguards or dental appliances.
       You have never had anything similar in the past.
       You have no other rashes or spots anywhere else on your skin or eyes.
       You do not have any known sensitivity to gluten, or other gastrointestinal issues.

       {{noother}}

       The photo you attached shows some irregularly shaped white spots on the inside
       (mucosal) surface of your upper lip. It is a little difficult to see due to
       the focus but it appears there is some small amount of ulceration.
       These spots are most likely aphthous ulcers.
       This is a benign condition usually triggered by stress or trauma (biting),
       or possibly acidic foods and usually heals on its own in 7-14 days.
       However we can use treatments to help minimize the symptoms and help healing.


       You are advised to avoid any trauma inside the mouth,
       avoid biting cheeks or lips, and avoid foods that exacerbate the symptoms
       (typically very acidic or spicey foods).

       You are advised to use the prescribed topical medications to help reduce symptoms:
       lidocaine viscous 2% 15 ml swish and spit (do not swallow) no more than every 3 hours
       before meals to relieve discomfort.  (150ml dispense with one refill)

       Oracort (triamcinolone 0.1%) paste applied to the lesions after meals to improve healing.
       Do not eat or drink for at least 30 minutes afterward. (7.5g dispense with no refills)

       Your main concern today is redness and swelling in your RIGHT TOP eyelid
       This developed about  XXXX days ago

       You have had no foreign object enter your eye.
       You have had no affect on your vision.
       You have had no discharge or drainage.
       The eyeball itself does not appear red.
       Moving your eye is not painful
       The eyelid is not painful at rest but is tender when pressed.

       You do not wear contact lenses.
       You have had no previous similar symptoms.
       You have had no treatment so far.

       {{noother}}

       Your eyelid appears somewhat red.
       There is a larger bulge near the lid margin and
       a whitehead of purulence visible.

       Your symptoms are consistent with a hordeolum or stye.
       These can almost always be treated successfully without antibiotics.

       You are advised to apply warm compresses several times a day:
       Use a clean washcloth and wet with warm water, placing over the stye.
       Once the cloth cools, reheat it and repeat for a total of 15 minutes,
       repeating this process at least 4 times daily.

       You are advised to avoid squeezing or popping the stye, and also avoid using
       contact lens or any cosmetic products around the eye until your symptoms are
       completely gone.
