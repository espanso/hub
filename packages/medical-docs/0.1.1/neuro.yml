        {{sp}} no improvement with drinking alcohol
        {{sp}} no previous treatment
        {{sp}} no family history of tremor

      Objective:
        Psychogenic Tremor:
        With rapid alternating movements of the contralateral limb, the tremor is
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED with fist open/close
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED with forearm pronation/supination
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED with foot tap on the floor

        Note: Typically parkinson disease resting tremor becomes more obvious
         psychogenic tremor disappears, or takes on rhythm of voluntary limb (entrainment).

        Action Tremor:
        The tremor is:
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED when drawing a spiral inside another spiral,
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED when joining 2 points between closely spaced straight lines
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED when pouring water from one glass to another

        Postural Tremor:
        The tremor is:
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED when arms are outstretched for 10-15s, with a loose sheet of paper on the hand(s)

        Kinetic Tremor
        The tremor is:
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED with nose-finger-nose movement
        BETTER WORSE UNCHANGED with knee-heel-shin movement

        Intention Tremor
        The tremor is NOT present during target-directed movements.
        Tremor amplitude is INCREASED DECREASED UNCHANGED as the hand approaches the target.

        Simple Kinetic Tremor
        The tremor is NOT present during all non-targeted movements
        such as repeated flexion-extension of the elbow or pronation-supination
        of the forearm.
        There is NO increase in amplitude in the terminal phase.

        Task Specific Tremor
        The tremor APPEARS WORSENS IMPROVES IS UNCHANGED with writing.
        The tremor APPEARS WORSENS IMPROVES IS UNCHANGED with playing a musical instrument
        The tremor APPEARS WORSENS IMPROVES IS UNCHANGED with holding a note.

        Isometric Tremor
        The tremor does NOT appear as a result of contraction of muscles
        against a rigid stationary object. 

      Assessment:
        There is a rhythmic, involuntary oscillation of the LEFT RIGHT UPPER LOWER limb,
        predominantly involving the WRIST AND DISTAL PORTION OF THEN FINGERS, NOT present at rest,
        INCREASED DECREASED UNCHANGED during activities, SLOW MODERATE FAST in frequency, 
        MILD MODERATE SEVERE in amplitude, INCREASED DECREASED UNCHANGED by distracting movements
        of other limbs and having NO entrainment.

        In summary, this appears to be a RESTING ACTION tremor.
        The tremor characteristics are most consistent with a POSTURAL KINETIC PSYCHOGENIC tremor.
        The kinetic tremor appears to be a SIMPLE KINETIC  INTENTION  TASK SPECIFIC  ISOMETRIC tremor.

        DDx:
        Tremor: rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of a body part
          Resting tremor: present in body part not voluntarily activated, completely
               supported against gravity (supported on armrest of chair)
          Action tremor: seen during voluntary activity of muscles.
             Postural tremor: with voluntary maintenance of antigravity position
             Kinetic tremor: present during voluntary movements
                 Simple kinetic tremor: present during all voluntary movements
                       that are not targeted
                 Intention tremor: present during target-directed movements
                       Worse as target is approached.
                 Task-specific tremor: exacerbated by specific activity
                 Isometric: with muscle contraction against rigid stationary object.

        Myoclonus: nonrhythmic, rapid, jerky, shocklike
        Steriotypy: repeated and continuous complex motor acts
        Epilepsia partialis continua: can be rhythmic, but movements
               do NOT change with alteration in position or activity.
        Clonus: rhythmic oscillations around a joint in response to
                sudden passive contraction.
                Increases in amplitude and force with passive stretching of muscles
        Dystonia: sustained muscular contractions frequently causing
                  twisting and abnormal posturing of a body part
        Tic: brief, nonrhythmic, rapid movements, usually orofacial, can be suppressed
             voluntarily with rebound increase afterward.
        Chorea: Non-rhythmic, nonstereotyped,semipurposive,relatively slow movements
               that flow from one part of the body to another.
