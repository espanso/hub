      Eczema Care Instructions:
      1. Bathing
        a. Not about frequency but duration. Must be between 5-15 minutes.
        b. Warm – lukewarm/moderate warm
        c. Do not wipe dry – Pat dry only. Leave some moisture on skin

      2. Do not use soap – use hypoallergenic baby wash once a week only (e.g. Cetaphil, Cerave, Avene, Aveeno)

      3. If needs medicated cream (Steroid (Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, Mometasone etc.) or Tacrolimus base Cream(Protopic/Elidel) ) – apply as first layer.
        a. Steroid must be used consecutively daily, then stop when controlled
           (do not use intermittently).
        b. Maximum daily use is 2 weeks
        c. After 2 weeks use of steroids must have 1-2 weeks of break
           then can resume using this again.
        d. Tacrolimus based meds can be used indefinitely until complete control.
        e. Minimize direct sun exposure when on medicated creams.

      4. Apply moisturizing creams (Cerave Cream, Vaseline Creamy, Avene Cream) – avoid lotions (has alcohol usually which dries the skin more)

      5. Add extra layer of Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline). Must be used at flare up and may be used in maintenance phase well.

      6. Maintenance – once Eczema is controlled NEVER STOP using moisturizer (e.g. Cerave) that works best for you.

      7. RELAPSE IS VERY HIGH IF YOU STOP MAINTENANCE!

      8. Improve moisture with use of humidifier, increase fluids, healthy diet (more fruits and veggies).
