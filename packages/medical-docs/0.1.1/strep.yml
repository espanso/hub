        -1, 0, 1 points - risk of strep infection <10%
            no antibiotic or throat culture necessary
        2 or 3 points - risk of strep 15% - 32%
            throat culture and antibiotics if culture is positive
        4 or 5 points - risk of strep 56%
            consider strep testing and/or culture
