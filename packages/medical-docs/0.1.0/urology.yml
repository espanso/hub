     Assessment:
       {{ap}} Primary Delayed Ejaculation (likely at least partly secondary to serotonergic medication]
       Primary delayed ejaculation is difficult to treat unless directly related to a medication.
       If a medication cause is suspected, strategies include:
       1) Switching SSRI to vilazodone (Viibryd) or low dose vortioxetine (Trintellix)
       2) Switching SSRI to SNRI - duloxetine (cymbalta) or levomilnacipran (Fetzima) likely best
       3) Adding mirtazapine (Remeron) or bupropion (Wellbutrin) to an SSRI

       If not medication related, it is usually related to anxiety, and overcontrolling or obsessive personality traits.
       Intensive counselling may be helpful.

       Most men are able to find specific stimuli when alone that help them reach their particularly high ejaculation threshold.
       Having their partner mimic these techniques may allow them to ejaculate with their partner. 

       Finally, a stimulant  (eg Dexedrine 5-10mg) 1 hour before sexual activity may help. 
       If this approach is effective, one should consider screening for ADHD.

     Plan:
       {{pp}} self refer to counselling
       {{pp}} trial a medication switch to vilazodone (Viibryd) vortioxetine (Trintellix)  duloxetine (Cymbalta) levominacipran (Fetzima)]

       {{pp}} trial dexedrine 5mg, taken one hour before sexual activity
       {{pp}} follow-up within 1 month regarding effectiveness of treatment, sooner if concerns

      Plan:
        {{pp}} complete testing for testosterone level (recommended 7 - 11am or within 3 hours of waking if shift work)
        and related levels to confirm diagnosis and allow monitoring during treatment

        Testing:
        Testosterone 7am-11am or within 3 h of rising for shift workers
        If borderline, use bioavailable testosterone - user pay or calculate with testosterone, SHBG, albumin
        www.issam.ch/freetesto.htm
        Bioavailable testosterone normal range (4.0 - 16.0)
        If normal, do not replace as may suppress natural production and pt feels worse!

        Additional testing FSH, LH, Prolactin, SHBG, Albumin (cFT or cBAT), TSH, Ferritin (or % iron
        saturation), CBC, PSA

        FSH, LH low indicates secondary hypogonadism

        Secondary hypogonadism causes:
        Kallmann syndrome - associated with color blindness, anosmia
        Pituitary disorders - pituitary tumor, or treatment for tumor
        Inflammatory disease - sarcoidosis, histiocytosis, tuberculosis
        HIV/AIDS
        Medications - opiates, hormones, glucocorticoids, ketoconazole
        Substances - etoh, heroin
        Obesity
        Normal aging
        Concurrent illness - severe OSA, liver disease, hemochromatosis, severe illness, surgery, emotional stress

        Treatment:
        Lifestyle: aerobic exercise and resistance training, healthy diet, sleep, stress mgt
        Huge overlap of pre-diabetes/diabetes/metbolic syndrome, erectile dysfunction, low testosterone
        Treatment should improve sexual function, reduce need for PDE-5 inhibitors

        TRT:
        Contraindications:   Metastatic Prostate CA, Hx of Breast Ca
        Side effects:
        Fertility: TRT suppresses sperm counts but fully reversible.  Either withdraw or use clomid
        CV risk: no convincing evidence of increased risk, but conflicting studies. Some suggest protection for pts with low T to start.
        Prostate CA: Does not cause but could enhance growth if already present

        Monitoring
        Prior to treatment:  Baseline DRE, 6 mo, 12mo, then annual
        Bloodwork (CBC, LFTs, Creatinine, BG/A1C, Lipids, PSA) prior to, 3,6,12mo, then annual

        If PSA rising to greater than age cutoff or >0.75/year, stop testosterone,
             recheck PSA and if still elevated, refer to urology (Rapid Access PSA Clinic in Calgary)

        Test level for Oral/transdermal - ideally 2 hours after dose (relative peak)
