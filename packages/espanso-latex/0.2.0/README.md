# espanso-latex

An espanso package to convert LaTeX symbol commands to Unicode symbols.

## Source

The LaTeX to Unicode symbol table comes from the [`unicode-math`](https://github.com/wspr/unicode-math) package.

## Usage

Use it as normal LaTeX symbols. Espanso 2.x can expand the matches based on word boundary.

For example: `\alpha` expands to `Î±`
