# Period Double Space
This package replicates the behavior of macOS and mobile keyboards, allowing you to double tap the space key to create a period.

## Credits

I, yellowwinner, only asked a question and packaged it. By default [**Espanso**](https://espanso.org/) does not let you have an empty trigger so after a couple of attempts this is the workaround. As far as I can tell this just works without issue. Thank you to `Archigos`, `.joh6nn` and `smeech0` on the [**Espanso Discord**](https://discord.gg/4QARseMS6k) for helping me get this to work. 

#### This package has only been tested on PikaOS 4 (Debian Sid)
