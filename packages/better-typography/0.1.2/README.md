# Better Typography

This is an Espanso package to help with converting quotes into smart quotes. I created the file when I realized I had extensions or plugins in multiple apps meant to assist with these conversions. This particular config file is inspired by the [Smart Typography](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-smart-typography) plugin for Obsidian by mgmeyers.
