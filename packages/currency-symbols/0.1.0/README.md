All the unicode symbols that I can find listed as being currency.
use the :$: shortcut to get a dialog allowing you to chose from a list, or for dong, euro, pounds, rupee, won yen use :- followed by the letter representing the currency or vice-versa, e.g. :-r or :r- for â‚¹ rupee. The mnemonic is that the symbol looks like the letter with a stroke through it.
For cents use :c. There are also full-width variants, use the same shortcut, but with upper case letters.
For all other currencies use :$: to bring up a menu.
