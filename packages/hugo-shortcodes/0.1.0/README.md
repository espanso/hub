# Hugo Shortcodes

An Espanso package for inserting [Hugo Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) in blog posts.

Hugo is " â€¦ one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again."

## Installation

Make sure you have already installed [Espanso](https://espanso.org/install/) first.

```sh
espanso install hugo-shortcodes
```

## Triggers

Triggers are mnemonic, and prefixed with an `:h`. For example, `:hv` inserts the Vimeo shortcode `{{< vimeo VIMEO_ID >}` etc.
