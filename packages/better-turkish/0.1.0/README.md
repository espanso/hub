# better-turkish

This is a package provides all the accented letters, including the ones that
are missing from the other Turkish language packages on the Hub.

It provides triggers that are less likely to collide with certain use cases,
such as common programming language syntaxes, other Espanso package triggers,
or hyphenated words.
