# CNSNNT Standard Edition

>"Why waste time type lot letter when **few letter do trick**."

This package is a set of shorthand triggers, allowing you to instantly expand common English words by typing (mostly) only their consonants. 

<small>**Want to go even faster?** For a package that only gives you the optimal word for every trigger, see [CNSNNT Highlander Edition](https://hub.espanso.org/cnsnnt-highlander).</small>


## üéØ Core Philosophy: Maximum Efficiency

The system is engineered for speed by employing a few simple substitution rules:

* **Vowel Skipping:** Most vowels are omitted (`btwn` &rarr; `between`).
* **Repeated Letter Compression:** Skip redundant letters (`acs` &rarr; `access`).
* **Silent Letter Removal:** Letters that don't affect pronunciation are dropped (`bkbn` &rarr; `backbone`).
* **Phonetic Substitution:** Type it how it sounds like (`tlfn` &rarr; `telephone`, `bjt` &rarr; `budget`).


## üí° Usage

While typing, simply input the consonant-based trigger. **Espanso** will instantly expand it into the full word.

* To **undo** an expansion, just press **backspace** immediately after it appears.

### Disambiguation

The first letter can be inputted to distinguish between words with similar consonant structures:

| Trigger | Expansion |
| :--- | :--- |
| **a**dtcn | **a**ddiction |
| **e**dtcn | **e**ducation |
