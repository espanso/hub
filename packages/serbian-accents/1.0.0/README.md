# Espanso Serbian Accent Letters

Simple package to extend [Espanso](https://espanso.org) with accented latin letters used in Serbian language.

In Serbian, the term "truncated" or "bald" letters (ošišana ili ćelava latinica) is used for latin letters that are missing accent marks but should be written with them. If you find it difficult to correctly enter proper Serbian latin letters with accents (latinična slova sa kvačicama) in your keyboard layout, you should use this package.

- caron letters (čČššžŽ),
- acute accent letters (ćĆ),
- crossed D, D with stroke, crossbar letter D (đĐ)

## Installation

Please make sure that you have already installed [Espanso](https://espanso.org/install) and then install as Espanso package.

You can now start using the package.
