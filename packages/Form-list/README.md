# Form list
## A package for getting a list of expansions from one form.

# Setup
The package.yml does not need to be edited.

You will need to customize the entries in the `form_urls.csv`. The sample lines are a good starting point. The basic syntax is:

| Name/description (without quotes) | URL |
| --- | --- |
| gmail | https://gmail.com/ |

**Separate the fields with a comma.** Remember to save the file.

## reuse

You can of course also copy the contents of this package and create multiple form lists with other text. 👍 If you do so, you will need to edit the global variable for the location of the csv file.
