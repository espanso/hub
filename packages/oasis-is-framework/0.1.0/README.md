# oasis-is-framework - espanso package

OASIS-IS a ChatGPT (or other chatbot) prompting mega framework, by [Rifter](https://github.com/Ryfter).  
This creates a form that lets you fill out the OASIS-IS framework, helping you to get bettter results from using ChatGPT, Claude, and other chat interfaces.

## Usage

There are two commands for using this framework inside of espanso.
1. **:oasis** - ChatGPT ONLY: This is meant to be used in the URL of your browser, or elsewhere, and copied to your URL.  This creates a full URL string that opens up ChatGPT and inserts your prompt. This one also lets you choose the ChatGPT Model used.
2. **:poasis** - This is for use in a prompt input box. It doesn't create a URL but adds the pieces of the OASIS-IS megaprompt to get you started for a conversation.  This works for any chatbot.

Not all fields need filled out.  Really, only the objective needs to be filled out.  I would recommend at least filling out the setting and archtype as well.  Filling out all fields will make it a better prompt overall.  The Interpretation / Framework has a list of output frameworks I have been working on for a while.  These work well if you have a specific need.  I've been working on this list for over a year.

## What is OASIS-IS?

OASIS-IS, is the acronym to help remember the fields needed for this framwork.  
**O**bjective : What do you want to accomplish?
**A**rchetype : Persona, identity, character, or profile.  This can be generic like a manager with 20 years workplace mediation experience, or specific like Batman, Mark Twain, or Jack Sparrow.
**S**etting : Context or background information
**I**llustrations : These are your examples.
**S**tyle : The tone, mood, or voice.  Examples: comedic, formal, casual, business casual.
**I**nterpretation : Output Framework or Structure.
**S**pecification : This is the output style, format, or how the output should look like.  Examples: Table, List, Paragraph, Code Block, etc.

There are two important steps after you create your initial prompt. 
**E**valuate : How was the response? Give feedback to your chatbot. 
**B**anter : OASIS-IS, is meant to start a conversation. A really good followup prompt is the following: 
*That is not specific enough.  Please make one more attempt, and re-research this from scratch.  Please go to all new sources and re-do the above analysis.  However you can still keep the previous research in mind, but make sure to make a second pass at your research and seek out more detailed, comprehensive analytical sources.*
